# Making Readmes and Journals in .md Files
---

Hello! Here I will be teaching you how to write nice looking Readmes and Journals and how to use .md files.\
This is different from the How To Ship tutorial in that this shows you how to write in markdowns whereas the other one teaches you how to properly ship your project.

## Basics

First we go over the basic things you need to know when making a markdown

### Titles

Titles separate large chunks of text into sections.\
Sure you can just make these the size of a normal line but that doesnt really do an effective job at separation, especially when some titles are more important than others.

To add a title to your Markdown, put a hashtag before the title.\
It should look like this: `# title`\
Make sure there is a space between the hashtag and title, otherwise it will look like\
#title\
which is not what you want.

To add stuff like subheadings, add more hashtags.\
`## h2` `### h3` and so on and so forth.

Its pretty easy once you get the hang of it.

### New Lines

You cant just press the enter key to start a new line in a markdown.\
You need to use these things called backward slashes. Its like a forward slash, but backwards.

```
{
hi
how are you
}
```
