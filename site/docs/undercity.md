# Undercity

Undercity is a 4 day hardware hackathon hosted at GitHub HQ in San Francisco, California from July 11-14th.

To qualify for Undercity, you need at least 12 points and 1 physically built, working hardware project.

## The points system

Points are awarded when you either:
- Attend an event that gives you 1 point
- Get a design approved
    - Starter projects: 4 points
    - Custom projects: 6/10 points.

By default, custom projects give you 6 points, but if its a particularly complicated project (i.e 3D printer), you can get 10 points out of it.

To get 10 points, you MUST get confirmation on your idea BEFORE working on it first. DM @alexren on the slack to check with them first!

## Travel Stipends

You'll automatically qualify for a reimbursment when you have **finished building the projects you submitted for undercity**. 

The amount will be revealed at the kickoff call!
