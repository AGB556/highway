# Project Guidelines

Great question!

The bottom line is this: build something *awesome*, something that you would be proud to keep in your room for the next 5 years.

## Examples
**Here are some examples of great projects:**
- Ducc's Spotify thing
- Alex's Neutrino
- Cyao's FPGA board
- Pi-tin?
- Throw some adafruit projects
- More to come

**Here are some examples of what *not* to build:**
- Arduino alarm clock
- Humidity display
- Distance sensor

**Here's some examples of how you could make those projects better:**
- Arduino alarm clock, but it has custom LED lighting that syncs with the time of day & also has a slide switch instead of a button
- A humidity display that's part of a larger weather station setup and compares the internal readings of your house compared 
- A distance sensor that checks if someone is coming to your room so you can alt tab back to homework.
