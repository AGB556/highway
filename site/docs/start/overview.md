# Guide

Welcome to the **Highway** to **Undercity**, an unforgettable summer of hardware running from now through July 31st.

Collect 12 points before July 1st to get invited to Undercity!

## Here's how it works:

### 1. Build hardware projects

#### Guided starter projects: 4 points each

No idea what to build? Perfect! Hack Club has a ton of resources for specific projects like macropads already available. 

Hit the **"Starters"** button in the top right to find them!

You'll learn how to design your first hardware project & get the parts & tools delivered to you to build it!

#### Fully custom projects: 6 points each

If you're already a seasoned hardware hacker, hit the "advanced" toggle on the top right!

It'll unlock a new tab that gives you everything you need to design your own projects.

### 2. Join weekly events

Every week, we'll host events like Speedruns, Game Nights, AMAs, and Showcases! 

Hit the button labeled "Events" to see them:


First one up is the Kickoff call on **insertdate**. Get your 1st point for free!


(P.S: you can some points from these!)

### 3. Get invited to Undercity

Once you collect 12 points, AND you've physically built 1 project, you'll get invited to Undercity[insertlink], a 4 day hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ from July 11-14.

It'll be filled to the *brim* with hardware - hundreds of microcontrollers, kilometers of cabling, and more 3D printing than you could ever need. (Did someone mention a PCB mill?)
